It works by using a hierarchical approach to fine-tuning, where the model is first fine-tuned on a small set of seed data, and then fine-tuned on a larger set of data. This allows for more accurate and efficient fine-tuning of LLMs, making them more accessible to a wider range of users. Additionally, QLoRA has the potential to significantly improve the performance of LLMs on specialized open-source data, and to enable the creation of models that can compete with the very best commercial models.'"

In a RAG system, the generator and retriever are trained separately and then integrated to form a single model. The generator is responsible for producing novel text, while the retriever is trained to retrieve relevant text from a large corpus. During inference, the generator and retriever work together to generate high-quality text that is both novel and relevant.
