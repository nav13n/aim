        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effetively allowing us to recreate appliation flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",

        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

Fine tuning is the process of tailoring a machine learning model to a specific application, which can be vital in achieving consistent and high quality performance. Let's jump on LoRA. Low-Rank Adaptation of LLMs (LoRA) So, in usual fine-tuning, we. Take a pretrained model. Do Transfer Learning over new training data to slightly adjust these pre-trained weights Feb 18, 2024. Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a machine learning technique that modifies a pretrained model (for example, an LLM or vision transformer) to better suit a specific, often smaller, dataset by adjusting only a small, low-rank subset of the model's parameters. This approach is important because it allows for efficient finetuning of ...

QLoRA achieves state-of-the-art performance on chatbot and instruction following tasks with a single GPU. Allen School Ph.D. student Tim Dettmers accepted the grand prize for QLoRA, a novel approach to finetuning pretrained models that significantly reduces the amount of GPU memory required — from over 780GB to less than 48GB — to finetune a 65B parameter model.

            "Tool Response: The attention mechanism is a technique used in machine learning and natural language processing to increase model accuracy by focusing on relevant data. It enables the model to focus on certain areas of the input data, giving more weight to crucial features and disregarding unimportant ones. 1. Introduction. Self-attention, also known as scaled dot-product attention, is a fundamental concept in the field of NLP and deep learning. It plays a pivotal role in tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, and sentiment analysis. The concept of \"attention\" in deep learning has its roots in the effort to improve Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for handling longer sequences or sentences. For instance, consider translating a sentence from one language to another. Translating a sentence word-by-word is usually not an option because it ignores the complex grammatical ...
